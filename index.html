  This letter represents the agenda of the Code Club TBMES. Code club TBMES was born in August 2017 and ever since it has continued to inspire and motivate pupil at Tyndale Biscoe School to transcend the boundaries of conventional education and explore the world of programming, with every step we've evolved, discovered, invented and progressed. Programming has been a part of the TBMES community for a very long time until at last recognition was established. Last year our goal included a basic and fundamental understanding of computer programming, having been blessed by vibrant success in our facade, this year we want to expand our reach and take it up a level and have this community act as a torchbearer for every institution. Code club community is a gregarious and social-able interaction, which subsists on pure teamwork and trust; here we not only aim to understand technology but for vibrant and vicarious communication through pure mathematics and logic.
  Every year by sincere efforts of the school management, teachers, and students, TBMES has continued to be drenched in success and emerge victorious at every phase. we have always held true to the motto that we hold so dearly to our hearts, the motto which has shaped our lives, taught us about many virtues and nurtured us with loyalty, respect, and humanity. This year the Code club community wishes to make a significant contribution and uphold the name of the school in this field as well.</p>

    <h1>Curriculum</h1>
    <p>This year at code club we aim to teach and create. This year we have taken students from both Biscoe as well as Mallinson School under our apprentice as we intend to pass down the torch to them, so that it may keep on burning as long as possible.  This year at code club our curriculum involves two main things: <br>
The School Newspaper <br>
In order to continue the process of creation at code club, we intend to issue a regular periodical school newspaper.Starting a school newspaper is something new in itself, it will not only impress a new trend in the school but also encourage art and creativity. This project will be a huge contribution to the society, where often views of teenagers are taken for granted, the school newspaper will serve a link between opinions and reality. Not only this but it will serve as a source of journalism and inspiration for those who want to make a difference and make our society better.<br>
 An Event <br>
Tyndale Biscoe And Mallinson School have been the host of many great events.This year the code club intends to organize an event based purely on programming and technology. Events are always eye-catching and organizing an event will prove to be center of learning, creativity, and innovation. Observing the "TechKnow" event held at D.P.S last year, our members have been inspired to do something extraordinary and much greater. The event will not only be an excellent chance for a student to observe and learn but also help us develop vital life skills.

      <h1>Requirements</h1>
      <p>To be victorious and successful in our facade, logistical and moral support of the school management is required. As for every activity support and motivation is required. In order to initiate proper functioning of the code club, the club needs a projector: so that displaying code is much easier, some permanent space and a daily slot in timetable which should at least be of 90 - 120 minutes.<br>
Sir, we want to take a lead in this project, as this has attained a big importance in the leading schools of India and the world, we are sure this will bring a good name and reputation to our school which otherwise is maintaining a good pace with the changing trends in the education system.
